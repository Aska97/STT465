### Analyses of MCMC Samples


In Bayesian Data Analyses we often use Monte Carlo (MC) methods to draw samples from the posterior distribution. These samples are used
to estimate features of the posterior distribution such as posterior means, posterior standard deviations, credibility regions, etc. The quality
of these MC estimates (i.e., how close our MC estimated posterior mean is from the true posterior mean) depends, among many factors, on how many
independent MC samples we have.
