## Ideas for Final Project

####Project 1											

*Title*: Multiple-Linear Regression with Binary Outcomes

*Programming*: implement a Gibbs sampler for a multiple-linear regression model and extend it to handle binary outcomes using the probit link.

*Analysis*:  using a real data set (this will be provided) analyze it using:
-	glm()
-	Your software

*Expected outcome*: a comparison of your results Compare your results with those obtained with glm.

####Project 2											
										

Title: Multiple-linear regression with censoring

Programming task: implement a Gibbs sampler for a linear regression model and extend it to handle right, left and interval censoring.

Analysis:  using a real data set (this will be provided) analyze it using:
- lm(), ignoring censoring
- Your software ignoring and accounting for censoring

Expected outcome: a comparison of your results with those provided by lm().


####Project 3										

Title: High dimensional regression

Programming: implement a Gibbs sampler for a linear regression model and extend it to handle two sets of predictors, one will be treated as fixed and the second one as random.
 
Analysis:  using a real data set (this will be provided) analyze it using:
-	BGLR
-	Your software

Expected outcome: a comparison of your results Compare your results with those obtained with BGLR.



####Project 4										

Title: non-parametric regression and automatic knot selection using Bayesian models

Programming: implement a Gibbs Sampler for a linear regression model, using a simulated data set (this will be provided) compare the use of natural splines with different degree of freedom and with the Bayesian approach.

Analysis:  analyze the simulated data set using splines with variable degree of freedom using lm() and the Bayesian software that you developed. 

Expected outcome: a comparison of your results  with those obtained with lm()
