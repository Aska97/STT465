a. keep only the common varieties from X1 and X2 
b. check whether there are common marker names in X1 and X2
check their genotypes to see whether they are true duplicates
	 these markers are not really duplicates although they have the same names: the mean rate of inconsistency was NaN 
	 rate of inconsistencies was saved in error.commonMarker.rda 

c. Put X1 and X2 infront of the original marker names;combine columns of X1 and X2 into X
