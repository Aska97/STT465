### Bonus Homework (counts up to 10 points of either midterm or final).

(1) Using the [gout](https://github.com/gdlc/STT465/blob/master/gout.txt) data set estimate the effects of sex, race and age on serum urate using the
`lm()` function.
     1.1. Report your results
     1.2. Summarize your findings.
     1.3. Report the code you used to obtain the results in 1.1. or 1.2.
     
     
 (2) Produce a table equal to summary(fm) using matrix operations. Your table must include estiamte, SE, t-statistic and p-value.
     2.1. Report your results and comment on any difference with 1.1.
     2.2. Report the code you used to produce the results reported in 2.1
    
 (3) Using the estimate effects reported in 1.1. produce a plot with age in the x-axis, expected serum urate in the y-axis and lines
 for male/white, female/white, male/black, female/black. Use fo the x-axis values ranging from 30 to 70.
