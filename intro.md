## An Overview of Statistical Inference: Why? and How?


   1. Statistical Inference
        - Inference & Prediction
        - Why we need Statistics at all?
   
   2. The Frequentist paradigm
      - Population/Sample/Estimator/Sampling distribution
      - Example: inference on the population mean.
      - [Simualtion example](samplingDistribution.md)
      - Important (frequentist) properites of estimators: Bias, Variance, Mean-Squared Error.
      - Some problems with Frequentist inference
        
   3. The Bayesian (Laplace?) Paradigm
      - [A bit of history](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ba/1340371071)
      - In Bayesian Inference:
           - We use probablities to describe beliefs (see Chapter 2 in the book for a discussion)
           - Inferences are based on the posterior probability of the uknonws (e.g., parameters) given the observables (i.e., data).
