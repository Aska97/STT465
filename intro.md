## An Overview of Statistical Inference: Why? and How?


   1. Statistical Inference
        - Inference & Prediction
        - Why we need Statistics at all?
   
   2. The Frequentist paradigm
          
            * Population/Sample/Estimator/Sampling distribution
            * Example: inference on the population mean.
            * [Simualtion example](samplingDistribution.md)
            * Important Frequentist properites of estimators: Bias, Variance, Mean-Squared Error.
            * Some problems with Frequentist inference
        
    3. The Bayesian (Laplace?) Paradigm
            * [A bit of history](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ba/1340371071)
            * Beliefs & Probability (Chapter 2).
